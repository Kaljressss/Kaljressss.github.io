                    One of the best horror games in the past few decades, Alien Isolation is a masterpiece in terrifying the player. The primary antagonist, the xenomorph, relentlessly stalks the player around a small, claustrophobic space station. Alien Isolation thrives by frequently directing the invulnerable xenomorph towards the player, constantly making them feel on edge. Moreover, the xenomorph is also able to use hiding places such as air vents in order to ambush and surprise the player, leading to a quick and gruesome death. The xenomorph also has one of the most advanced AIs of any horror game, enables the monster to be both adaptable and unpredictable, allowing the player to feel ever unsafe though still feeling rewarded after surviving through sequences with the alien.

                    Fear has been a fundamental evolutionary response shared by nearly all animals since the dawn of time, from the simple snail to the modern human â€” though to vastly different extents. Some creatures may experience it through basic survival instincts, others, such as humans, process it through complex emotional and cognitive systems. This instinct exists to ensure the safety and survival of their species. Horror thrives by tapping into this primitive mechanic, turning ancient survival instincts into an engaging and exciting experience. Understanding horror, therefore, requires understanding the nature of fear itself.

                    Fear stems from a perceived lack of control. Humans and animals all seek safety, and control is the aside way in which they can asidetain it. One of the most universal fears, the fear of the unknown, demonstrates this clearly. The unknown presents a situation where there may be a possible threat which cannot be prepared for. This then elicits a negative response in fear and thus helping people to avoid situations which they cannot defend and protect themselves.
